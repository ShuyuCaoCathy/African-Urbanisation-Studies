# African-Urbanisation-Studies
It displays quantitative studies on Afircan Urbanisation.

There are three projects:

1. Python: Map visualisations studying Urbanisation Level and Metropolitcan Populations

   -Goal: to observe how those two variables interplay on map to grasp initial ideas on the countries that worth noticing.
   
   -Result: found out that there are countries showing contradictory negative interplay between Urbanisation Level and Metropolitcan Populations. Further studies are needed.

3. Mapbox 1: Interactive map visualisation displaying how the populations change in various African cities.  

   -Goal: to observe the population growth regional patterns and the potential populations shifts within one region.
   
   -Result: found out the initial population gatherings.

4. Mapbox 2: Map visualisations showing Population Reference Points and allowing detailed city explorations on the Mapbox 
   
   -Goal: to observe where Population Reference Points (including People of Concerns) locate
   
   -Outcome: https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/shuyucathy/cm7wbeh1e00pz01sd129l91rq.html?title=view&access_token=pk.eyJ1Ijoic2h1eXVjYXRoeSIsImEiOiJjbTd1cnU1engwMnhsMmtxdWtlb3Y0OXRxIn0.1GHApXadfjRjPkm4X_xAdA&zoomwheel=true&fresh=true#2/38/-34
   
     -Utilisation:
      
      -  users can observe the travel transitions in red dots, the other colored dots being the population centroids search for     
                  cities' names, zoom in and zoom out

      - users can also use control + left click to change the view to be 3D and observe the urban planning including the buildings and routes, with the dots that show transitions and PRPs  
   
   -Result: found out the urban planning of places in details and the areas that need more urbanising attentions.
